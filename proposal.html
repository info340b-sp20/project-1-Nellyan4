        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Reading nowadays becomes like "eating snacks". People loves to scroll down the
            screen very fast and only skim through the articles or posts. For many the social
            media platforms, it is designed to let the users skim through the content and
            move towards the next. However, this is sometimes frustrating to me. Quotes motivates 
            and inspires people to do good. While reading or browsing, it is good to note down some quotes. 
            Sometimes when I wanted to look up for some posts, quotes, memes that I read before, I have
            no way to find it back. Few of the social media platforms have functions that allow 
            people to store information. With this I mean something like an application that 
            makes and stores beautiful quotes, so that users can read the quotes back in the 
            future.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            My proposed application would be to create a website that allow users to store
             quote/Twitter/post/meme easily. Users include all readers and users of social media platforms
             such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit. The users only have to input the author and the content of 
             a quote or share the link of a social media post, and the website can generate a store a quote page for the users!

        <ul>
            <li>It helps prevent the "snack reading" situation.</li>
            <li>People have a good feeling reading back their stored content.</li>
        </ul>
